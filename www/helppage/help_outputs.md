For most interactive visualizations of this app, there is an option to download the results. Even better, for all tables and most plots, it is possible to download the underlying data directly. Please be aware that visualisations and tables are filtered by your inputs in the data control panel. 

Outputs are provided as PNGs for visualizations, and as CSVs for tables.
