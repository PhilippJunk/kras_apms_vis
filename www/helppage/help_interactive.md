There are multiple ways to interact with the data.

#### Ontology control panel

Probably the central control point of the app. Here, users can select which GO term to investigate in depth. Apart from being a searchable list, it is also possible to select a new GO term from various other sections of the app, whenever a list of GO terms is presented.

This control panel comes with additional features, namely a history of previously visited GO terms, and a button for random choice.

#### Data control panel

Controls which mutation status and which condition/concentrations to show for the analysis of individual GO terms. 

#### Heatmap control panel

Only available in the interactive version of the app. Here, the reference groups can be chosen for the data heatmaps. Additionally, the heatmap can be filtered to show only terms for which a significant result in one of the data heatmaps shows up. Also, the heatmap can be filtered to only show specific semantic clusters.

#### Global settings

There are a few global settings to control, mostly related to image export/download and when showing a limited number of objects.

#### Others

Some of the visualizations come with their own interactivity. For examples, the tables showing the results of the statistic analysis come with a slider input to control the p-value cut off. These inputs should be self explanatory.
